# Differential Gene Expression Analysis
# *Schistocephalus solidus*

## Various R/Python codes
**Description**
This repo contains various codes built to analysis RNA-seq data obtained for the cestode *S. solidus*.
These codes simply serve as a reference to better understand how the dataset was analyzed and what were
the exact parameters used in each package. They are not intended for direct re-use by other researchers,
as they were optimized in the very specific context of our dataset (see [Hebert et al. 2016](https://gigascience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13742-016-0128-3) for details).

These codes are made available so that anybody can download them, read and understand them and maybe use
some of the command lines for integration in another context, in another code. Our aim here is to make
all of our analytical tools available for replicability purposes.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Use these codes at your own risks, they might require a little bit of tweaking before working on other
computers in other systems.
